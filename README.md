### About
The idea of this repo is to host unmodified decompiled shaders for Saints Row 2 that can be compiled and used in the game, alongside custom/modified ones.

### Contributing

You can open a PR or contact me to add shaders to the repo but please make sure they can recompile correctly and that they works in the game first. Compare with the assembly of the original shader/s for that.
